You can use this project to build a Docker container image. Using a container based on this image, you can develop http://www.alpinelinux.org/[Alpine Linux] https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Developer_Documentation#Building_from_source_and_creating_packages[Aports packages] easily from your existing, non-Alpine Linux workstation.

Please issue all of the following shell statements from within the root directory of this repository.

== To build the image

=== To configure build

Take a look at link:.env[`.env`].
It contains shell variables relevant to the build.

. `MATCHING_UID`: the user ID on your Docker host of your OS user account, as a developer.
Find it out by e.g. issuing `id`.
It needs to match `alpine-developer`’s user ID, the user to use inside the container.
. `REGISTRY`: the Docker registry that the built image will be tagged as belonging to.
The default is normally okay.

NOTE: In the following, substitute `fish` with the name of a shell executable, e.g. `bash`.

=== To run the build

[source,sh]
----
sh -a -c -x -- '. ".env" && fish -i'
sudo -E packer build 'recipes/Docker.json'
----
